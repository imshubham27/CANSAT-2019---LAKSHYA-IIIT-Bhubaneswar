# CANSAT

A CanSat is a simulation of a real satellite, integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drink can. The challenge for the students is to fit all the major subsystems found in a satellite, such as power, sensors and a communication system, into this minimal volume.

#CANSAT Competition 2019 - Team LAKSHYA(IIIT Bhubaneswar)

CanSat Competition is set up to give students an experience that closely resembles what they could go through as aerospace or electrical engineers when designing, building, and flying true orbital or deep space satellites.\
Each year,  American Astronautical Society designs a new mission challenge.The 2019 mission will explore the use of auto-gyro descent control of a science payload when released from the launch vehicle. The CanSat shall consist of two parts, the science payload and the container to protect the science payload as it is deployed from the rocket.
